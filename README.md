## Overview

The **Real-Time Inventory Monitoring System** is a comprehensive application designed to provide real-time tracking, management, and forecasting of inventory levels. This system helps businesses monitor their stock levels, forecast demand, and optimize inventory management. The core components of the system include:

- **ARIMA Forecasting**: Utilized for accurate demand forecasting based on historical inventory data.
- **Frontend**: Developed using **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Backend**: The backup system is implemented using **Java** for secure data handling and backup operations.
- **Database**: **MySQL** serves as the relational database for storing inventory data, sales transactions, and forecast information.

This project is part of our **Capstone Thesis** aimed at improving inventory management through data-driven decision-making and advanced forecasting techniques.

## Features & Functionalities

- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Users can view the current stock levels of various products in real time.
- **Demand Forecasting**: The system uses the **ARIMA** model to predict future demand based on historical inventory data.
- **Inventory Alerts**: Notifications for low stock levels and overstock conditions.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs showing inventory trends, sales forecasts, and product performance.
- **Admin Panel**: Admin users can add, edit, or delete products, manage stock levels, and view detailed inventory reports.
- **Secure Backup**: Data is periodically backed up using the **Java**-based backup system, ensuring data integrity and recovery in case of system failure.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Java (for backend), Python (for ARIMA)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Forecasting Model**: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Other Libraries**:

  - **React query**: For making HTTP requests to the backend
  - **Chart.js** or **Recharts**: For data visualization in the frontend
  - **JDBC**: For Java's MySQL connectivity
